About

This visualization portrays the amount of men and women that are enrolled in STEM programs each academic year in school. This visualization not only conveys the dramatic discrepancy between men and women enrollment but highlights the increase for both parties towards the end of college.


## Design Process


The design process started by making each member explore the dataset and bring a Tableau-designed visualization to the first meeting. This helped the group get a better understanding of the data as well as let each person create their own opinion on what the most important variables were. The first meeting began with each member sharing their visualization and explaining their motivation behind it. This was followed by a discussion where each member gave their opinion on which visualizations or combinations of them we should use. The final designs were chosen shortly after. The constructive nature of this discussion was extremely beneficial and accelerated the design process.
