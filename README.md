# Project 2



## Goal
We want to create visualizations that will explain what the current demographics of NCWIT are for perspective and current individuals.
___

### Visualization One

Required Software: None

How to run

```
1) Open a terminal and switch into the project directory
2) run "sudo pip install -r requirements.txt"
3) run "./run.sh"
```

About

This visualization illustrates the distribution in majors enrolled in by women. The Sankey diagram shows the amount of women in each program or sub-program by the width of each path. The interactive aspect of the visualization is the ability to hover over a link between two rings and a popup of how many students in that category will appear. We chose this visualization idea because it aesthetically encompasses everything we wanted to portray without being cluttered.

### Visualization Two

Required Software: None

How to run
```
1) Open a terminal and switch into the project directory
2) run "python yearRace.python"
```
About

This visualization exhibits the diversity of the women in STEM programs over time. The use of multiple lines makes it easy for users to compare data and recognize trends without clutter. This visualization reveals that the amount of women going into STEM programs have generally increased since 2001.


### Visualization Three

Required Software: anaconda

How to run
```
1) Open anaconda prompt within project folder
2) Enter "jupyter notebook"
3) In the pop-up browser, click on "Visualization Three"
4) On the tool bar select "cell" and click "Run All"
5) Take a deep breath and enjoy
```
About

This visualization portrays the amount of men and women that are enrolled in STEM programs each academic year in school. This visualization not only conveys the dramatic discrepancy between men and women enrollment but highlights the increase for both parties towards the end of college.


## Design Process


The design process started by making each member explore the dataset and bring a Tableau-designed visualization to the first meeting. This helped the group get a better understanding of the data as well as let each person create their own opinion on what the most important variables were. The first meeting began with each member sharing their visualization and explaining their motivation behind it. This was followed by a discussion where each member gave their opinion on which visualizations or combinations of them we should use. The final designs were chosen shortly after. The constructive nature of this discussion was extremely beneficial and accelerated the design process.
