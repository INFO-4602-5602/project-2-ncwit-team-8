# Project 2



## Goal
Diversity and inclusivity are just a small part of any company, yet it's one of the most important factors one could focus on. It not only betters the company, but it betters the people working there. Bringing in people with different backgrounds allows for fresh, new perspectives and open minds, thus leading to innovation that can benefit a wider audience. What's even better is that diversity encourages future generations to continue the journey when more people like them are represented. The different skillsets and experience that people can bring to tech-related fields has the power to change the way we think, live, and work- but it also has the ability to turn others away when only a few are represented. 

We wanted to create visualizations that would explain what the current demographics of NCWIT are for perspective and current individuals. These visualizations would allow people to determine answers to questions such as 'what are the current demographics of NCWIT?' and 'If I were to join, would I be able to relate to other colleagues, through my race, major, or demographic?'We hope that by creating these visualizations, individuals are able to not only see if NCWIT is a good fit for them but open the conversation further to determine what they want bring to the table.

### Visualization One

Required Software: None

How to run

```
1) Open a terminal and switch into the project directory
2) run "sudo pip install -r requirements.txt"
3) run "./run.sh"
```

About:

This visualization illustrates the distribution of majors enrolled in by women. The Sankey diagram portrays the amount of women in each program or sub-program by the width of each path. The interactivity of the visualization comes through the user's ability to hover over a link between two rings that would pop up a number of students within that category. We chose this visualization idea because it aesthetically encompasses everything we wanted to portray without being cluttered. In terms of answering questions, we believe that this visualization is a great way to show all of the possible majors available in each field as well as the number of female students. This could open up a conversation about where an individual might see themselves in the future or help them discover a major they didn't even know exisited. 

### Visualization Two

Required Software: None

How to run
```
1) Open a terminal and switch into the project directory
2) run "python yearRace.python"
```
About: 

This visualization exhibits the diversity of women in STEM programs over time. The use of multiple lines makes it easy for users to compare data and recognize trends while being clutter-free. This also reveals that the amount of women going into STEM programs have generally increased since 2001. For many individuals, a large portion of choosing a career or possible interest is knowing whether or not there will be someone else they can connect to. Whether that's through gender, age, ability, or even sexual orientation, understanding what a company has to offer someone is crucial to recruitment. We hope that this visualization will not only allow users to explore the foundations that have been set, but understand that there is still plenty of space to grow. 


### Visualization Three

Required Software: anaconda

How to run
```
1) Open anaconda prompt within project folder
2) Enter "jupyter notebook"
3) In the pop-up browser, click on "Visualization Three"
4) On the tool bar select "cell" and click "Run All"
5) Take a deep breath and enjoy
```
About: 

This visualization portrays the amount of men and women that are enrolled in STEM programs each academic year in school. This visualization not only conveys the dramatic discrepancy between men and women enrollment but highlights the increase for both parties towards the end of their time in college. One might come to the conclusion that showing this discrepancy might be a turn-off for females looking into these fields, however because this visualization also presents the increase in both parties, it's safe to predict that for some, that may be enough to peak interest. Having a male-dominated field, or any field that possesses a majority of one common group may not impact everyone, but for those that it does, it is vital for a company to address the current demographic situations in order to allow an individual to understand what they are getting into. Being transparent about these numbers also demonstrates that they, as a company, are working to improve their diversity. 


## Design Process


The design process started by having each member explore the dataset and bring a Tableau-designed visualization to the first meeting. This helped the group gain a better understanding of the data as well as let each person create their own opinion on what the most important variables were. The first meeting began with each member sharing their visualization and explaining their motivation behind it. This was followed by a discussion where each member gave their opinion on which combination of visualizations the team should use and why with the final designs being chosen shortly after. The constructive nature of this discussion was extremely beneficial and accelerated the design process. The process continued through multiple meetings, which allowed each team member to discuss their process, where they were heading/wanting to go, and where help might be needed. Having in-person conversations was beneficial in that it allowed us to get answers quickly and brainstorm more efficiently.
